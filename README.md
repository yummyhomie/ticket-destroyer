#ticket-extirpator

ex·tir·pate (verb) -> "root out and destroy completely."

I made this program to absolutely eliminate tickets that I have to respond to daily. Some of them are very repetitive so I made this to take the repeated responses, and automate them to save me a few minutes of time. This is a sick project so far :)
