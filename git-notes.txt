git clone https://github.com/yummyhomie/ticket-extirpator.git
    - This makes it so that you "clone" everything that's on github to your local computer

git add .
    - This "adds" any new changes or files that you made

git commit -m 'Message Update'
    - This then takes whatever you've "added" and commits them to memory! It'll only save what you tell it to (which is why you wanna hit add everytime)

git push origin (directory)
    - This then takes your commits, (whatever you've commited to memory), and pushes them to github online!
